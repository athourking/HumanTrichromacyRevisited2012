% 'Human Color Sensitivity: Trichromacy Revisited'
%  by Horiguchi, Winawer, Dougherty and Wandell.
%
%
% Figure Caption:
% Trichromatic theory can explain foveal measurements. A 3-mechanism model
% (Figure 2) must have an invisible direction in a 4 primary display.
% Panel (A) shows the spectral power distributions of the invisible stimuli
% at the fovea according to the model fits.  The spectral patterns are
% similar for two subjects (S1: black outline, S2: gray). The shaded areas
% show 80% confidence interval based on a bootstrap procedure: We fit the
% model 1,000 times, each fit omitting 10% of the data selected at random.
% (B) Responses to the foveal stimulus in the invisible direction at 10%
% modulations are shown in LMS space for S1 according to two models of LMS
% spectral sensitivity: the standard color observer (gray) and models fit
% to the individual to account for pigment density in the lens, macula, and
% cone outer segments (black outline; see Figure S2 for details). Assuming
% the standard color observer, the cloud of bootstrapped LMS responses is
% far from the origin, indicating that (according to this model) a 10%
% modulation of the invisible stimuli evokes about a 2% response in each of
% the L, M, and S cones. However, after correction for the individual cone
% pigment densities, the LMS responses to the invisible stimuli for S1 lie
% near the origin, indicating that the invisible light is also the
% cone-silent light, as predicted by Trichromatic theory. Histograms on the
% cone axes show the distribution of cone responses to the invisible
% stimuli according to the standard observer model (gray) or the individual
% observer (black outline). (C) Distribution of bootstrapped LMS responses
% to the invisible foveal stimuli in two subjects. Histograms show
% distances from the origin in 3D LMS space. In both S1 and S2, LMS
% responses are far from the origin when fit using the standard observerâ€™s
% pigment densities (median of S1 and S2 LMS responses; 3.3 and 4.5%,
% respectively). After pigment density correction, the invisible stimuli
% are also the cone-silent stimuli.
