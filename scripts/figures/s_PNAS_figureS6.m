% Estimated cone absorptions for the Trichromacy fit in the periphery for
% S2 and S3. Estimated cone absorptions to the stimuli predicted to be
% invisible in the periphery according to the best fitting three-pigment
% model (10 % modulation) for S2 (panel A) and S3 (panel B). Using
% Stockman’s pigment density (gray circles), the estimated invisible
% stimuli evoked significant levels of cone absorptions. These absorptions
% don’t cluster like S1 (Figure 5B, main text). Correcting pigment
% densities based on the foveal experiments (black outline circles) did not
% reduce the estimated cone absorptions. Even if pigment densities are
% allowed to be biologically implausible, cone absorptions are still
% predicted to be high enough to evoke a detectable response (not shown).
