Human Trichromacy Revisited

This repository contains the source code to replicate key results from the published paper:

Required operating enviroment
 
Matlab (ver 7.11.0).  The code probably runs on earlier versions, 
but we have not checked extensively.

We know that it runs under Matlab in Linux and MacOS; probably OK in Windows 7.
 
The code also requires three toolboxes you can download freely:

 1) vset (github Brian A. Wandell, Stanford)
   http://github.com/wandell/vset

 2) vistadisp(Wandell lab, Stanford)
   http://white.stanford.edu/newlm/index.php/Software#VISTADISP

 3) psychtoolbox (David Brainard, U Penn.)
   http://psychtoolbox.org/HomePage

All of this software must be on your path. We wish the world would be a simpler place.

If you use this software please cite the article above.
